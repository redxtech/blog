hello friends! one of my favourite personal projects that i've worked on has been [pingbot][0]. pingbot is a discord bot that i created mostly as a joke, but has progressed into something much greater... today i will be going over some of pingbot's main features, why i made them that way, and go over how to set up your own instance of pingbot!
